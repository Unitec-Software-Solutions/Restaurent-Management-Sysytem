## 🗂️ Route Organization Structure

### Exported Route Groups
```
routes/groups/
├── admin.php (206 routes) - Admin panel routes
├── guest.php (17 routes) - Guest/public user routes  
├── public.php (79 routes) - General public access routes
├── auth.php (1 route) - Authentication routes
├── health_report.php - System health metrics
└── suggestions.php - Optimization recommendations
```

### Critical Route Fixes Applied

1. **Admin Branch Routes** - Fixed organization parameter requirements
   ```php
   // Before (broken)
   Route::get('branches/create', [BranchController::class, 'create'])
   
   // After (working)
   Route::prefix('organizations/{organization}')->group(function () {
       Route::get('branches/create', [BranchController::class, 'create'])
           ->name('branches.create');
   });
   ```

2. **Sidebar Parameter Injection**
   ```php
   // Before (missing parameters)
   'route' => 'admin.branches.create'
   
   // After (proper parameters)
   'route' => 'admin.branches.create',
   'route_params' => ['organization' => $admin->organization_id]
   ```

3. **User Creation Routes** - Moved to proper admin middleware groups
   ```php
   // Added proper organization and branch-specific user creation
   Route::get('organizations/{organization}/users/create')
   Route::get('organizations/{organization}/branches/{branch}/users/create')
   ```
