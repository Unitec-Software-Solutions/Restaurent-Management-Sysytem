# Admin Sidebar Update - Unified Order Flow

## 📋 Summary of Changes

The admin sidebar has been successfully updated to reflect the new unified order management flow. All legacy takeaway-specific routes and menu items have been consolidated into a unified system.

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. AdminSidebar Component (`app/View/Components/AdminSidebar.php`)

**Updated `getOrderSubItems()` method:**
- ✅ Removed legacy "Takeaway Orders" link that pointed to `admin.orders.takeaway.index`
- ✅ Added unified "Create Order" menu item pointing to `admin.orders.create`
- ✅ Added "Dine-In Orders" filter that points to `admin.orders.index?type=in_house`
- ✅ Updated "Takeaway Orders" to filter main index: `admin.orders.index?type=takeaway`
- ✅ Updated both `getMenuItems()` and `getMenuItemsEnhanced()` methods for consistency

**New sidebar structure under "Orders":**
```
Orders
├── All Orders (admin.orders.index)
├── Create Order (admin.orders.create) ← NEW UNIFIED
├── Dine-In Orders (admin.orders.index?type=in_house) ← NEW FILTER
└── Takeaway Orders (admin.orders.index?type=takeaway) ← UPDATED FILTER
```

### 2. AdminOrderController (`app/Http/Controllers/AdminOrderController.php`)

**Updated `indexTakeaway()` method:**
- ✅ Changed from rendering separate view to redirecting to unified index with filter
- ✅ Now redirects to: `admin.orders.index?type=takeaway`

**Enhanced `index()` method:**
- ✅ Added support for `type` parameter (in addition to existing `order_type`)
- ✅ Handles both `?type=takeaway` and `?order_type=takeaway` for flexibility

### 3. Orders Index View (`resources/views/admin/orders/index.blade.php`)

**Updated page title:**
- ✅ Dynamic title based on current filter:
  - "All Orders" (default)
  - "Takeaway Orders" (when `?type=takeaway`)
  - "Dine-In Orders" (when `?type=in_house`)

**Updated action buttons:**
- ✅ Replaced "Create Takeaway" with unified "Create Order"
- ✅ Enhanced button styling with icons and better UX
- ✅ Maintained "Create Reservation" button for reservations

### 4. Route Structure

**Maintained backward compatibility:**
- ✅ `admin.orders.takeaway.index` still exists but redirects to unified index
- ✅ `admin.orders.takeaway.create` redirects to unified create form
- ✅ Main routes (`admin.orders.index`, `admin.orders.create`) handle all order types

## 🔄 User Experience Flow

### Before (Legacy):
1. User clicks "Takeaway Orders" → Separate takeaway index page
2. User clicks "Create Takeaway" → Separate takeaway create form
3. Dine-in and takeaway orders managed separately

### After (Unified):
1. User clicks "Takeaway Orders" → Main orders index filtered by takeaway
2. User clicks "Create Order" → Unified form with order type selection
3. All orders managed through single interface with filtering
