## 🎯 Critical Fixes Applied

### Sidebar Parameter Issue - RESOLVED ✅
**Problem:** Sidebar links to `admin.branches.create` were missing required organization parameter

**Solution Applied:**
```php
// In AdminSidebar.php - getBranchSubItems()
$createParams = $admin->is_super_admin ? [] : ['organization' => $admin->organization_id];

$subItems[] = [
    'title' => 'Add Branch',
    'route' => 'admin.branches.create',
    'route_params' => $createParams,  // ← Fixed parameter injection
    'icon' => 'plus',
    'permission' => 'branches.create',
    'is_route_valid' => $this->validateRoute($createRoute, $createParams)
];
```

### Route Organization - RESOLVED ✅
**Problem:** User creation routes were outside proper admin middleware groups

**Solution Applied:**
```php
// Moved to proper admin middleware group in routes/web.php
Route::prefix('organizations/{organization}')->group(function () {
    Route::get('users/create', [UserController::class, 'create'])->name('users.create');
    Route::get('branches/{branch}/users/create', [UserController::class, 'create'])->name('branch.users.create');
});
```

### Safe Route Handling - IMPLEMENTED ✅
**Added Blade directives for safe route usage:**
```blade
@routeexists('admin.branches.create')
    <a href="{{ route('admin.branches.create', ['organization' => $org_id]) }}">Create Branch</a>
@else
    <span class="disabled">Route not available</span>
@endrouteexists
```
