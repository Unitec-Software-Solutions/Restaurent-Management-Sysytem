```bash
# Reset database and run comprehensive seeding
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed --seeder=ExhaustiveSystemSeeder
```

### Using Test Scripts

```bash
# Make executable and run
chmod +x test-comprehensive-seeding.php
./test-comprehensive-seeding.php
```

#### Windows PowerShell
```powershell
# Run with automatic confirmation
.\test-comprehensive-seeding.ps1 -Force

# Run with skip confirmation
.\test-comprehensive-seeding.ps1 -SkipConfirmation
```

## üìä Expected Data Volumes

After running the exhaustive seeding system, you should expect approximately:

- **Subscription Plans**: 8-12 different plans
- **Organizations**: 15-20 organizations of various types
- **Branches**: 25-40 branches across all organizations
- **Users & Admins**: 80-120 user accounts with various roles
- **Menu Items**: 200-400 menu items with variations
- **Orders**: 150-300 orders with different statuses
- **Reservations**: 100-200 reservations with various scenarios
- **Inventory Items**: 300-500 inventory items with edge cases
- **Kitchen Stations**: 40-80 stations across all branches

## üîç Validation Features

The seeding system includes built-in validation to ensure:

- **Data Integrity**: All foreign key relationships are maintained
- **Business Logic**: Realistic scenarios that follow business rules
- **Edge Cases**: Boundary conditions and error scenarios
- **Performance**: Reasonable data volumes for testing
- **Consistency**: Coherent data across all modules

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

### Adding New Scenarios

1. Create a new seeder class extending `Illuminate\Database\Seeder`
2. Implement comprehensive scenarios in the `run()` method
3. Add your seeder to `ExhaustiveSystemSeeder.php`
4. Update the test scripts to validate your new scenarios

### Modifying Data Volumes

You can adjust data volumes by modifying the loop counts and random ranges in individual seeders. Look for:

```php
for ($i = 0; $i < rand(min, max); $i++) {
    // Seeding logic
}
```

### Custom Business Rules

Each seeder includes business logic specific to restaurant operations. You can modify these rules to match your specific requirements:

- **Subscription limits** in `ExhaustiveSubscriptionSeeder.php`
- **Branch types** in `ExhaustiveBranchSeeder.php`
- **Menu patterns** in `ExhaustiveMenuSeeder.php`
- **Order workflows** in `ExhaustiveOrderSeeder.php`

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Foreign Key Constraints**
   - The system disables foreign key checks during seeding
   - If you encounter issues, check your model relationships

2. **Memory Limits**
   - Large datasets may require increased PHP memory limits
   - Use `ini_set('memory_limit', '512M')` if needed

3. **Execution Time**
   - Complete seeding may take 2-5 minutes
   - Use `set_time_limit(0)` for unlimited execution time

### Performance Optimization

- **Batch Inserts**: Use `DB::table()->insert()` for large datasets
- **Disable Timestamps**: Use `timestamps = false` during bulk operations
- **Index Optimization**: Ensure proper database indexes exist

## üìù Data Quality Features

### Realistic Data
- **Sri Lankan Context**: Names, addresses, and business types reflect local context
- **Seasonal Patterns**: Menu items and inventory reflect seasonal availability
- **Business Hours**: Realistic operating hours and schedules
- **Currency**: Local currency formatting and amounts

### Edge Case Coverage
- **Boundary Testing**: Min/max values for all numeric fields
- **State Transitions**: All possible status changes
- **Concurrent Operations**: Overlapping reservations and resource conflicts
- **Data Validation**: Input validation and constraint testing

## üéØ Testing Scenarios

The seeded data enables testing of:

### Functional Testing

- Order processing workflows
- Inventory management operations
- Reservation handling

### Performance Testing
- Database query optimization
- Large dataset handling

## üîí Security Testing

The seeding system creates scenarios for testing:

- **Permission Boundaries**: Users attempting unauthorized actions
- **Data Isolation**: Multi-tenant data separation
- **Audit Trails**: Change tracking and accountability
- **Input Validation**: SQL injection and XSS prevention

## üöÄ Getting Started
